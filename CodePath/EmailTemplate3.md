# Scenario C: Applicant who missed the deadline
Dear Anne,


I hope all is well.

I understand being admitted into the Summer Interview Prep Course is important to you, regretfully, the deadline for submitting an application has passed and we already filled up the slots in our waitlist. Should anything change, we will reach out to you.

Our goal has always been to accommodate as many people as possible, but to maintain the quality of our programs, we have to adhere to our guidelines and policies. This has been a hard decision to make, but we strongly feel it is the right one. 

You had mentioned that you had already applied to several other programs, but have not been able to hear back. In our pursuit to spread knowledge, here are some [guidelines](https://https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) that may be able to help with your applications.

We encourage you to subscribe to our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst), so we can keep you updated on any future courses that we feel may interest you. Should an opportunity arise, we hope to see you enrolled in our programs in the future!

We wish you great success!


Sincerely,
