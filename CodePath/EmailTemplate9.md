# Scenario I: Student wants to drop the course

Hi Thomas,


First and foremost, congratulations on securing an internship at Microsoft!

I received your request to drop out from the CodePath Android Course. I’m sure you have a lot going on, so let me help you make this easier. [Here’s](https://support.codepath.org/help/interview-prep-how-can-i-withdraw-from-the-program) the set of instructions to follow when you want to withdraw from the program.

After completing the process, you will be considered an ‘Observer’ of the course. This means that you will have lifetime access to the course material and will be able to study at your own pace. There will be no pressure from us at all. You will not have access to the live sessions for this course, however. 

Please consider subscribing to our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst), so we can keep you updated on any future courses that we feel may interest you. Should an opportunity arise, we hope to see you enrolled in our programs in the future!

Although we are sorry to see you leave, we are equally excited for you! We wish you the best of luck in your endeavors!


Sincerely,
