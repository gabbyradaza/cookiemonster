# Scenario D: Tech Fellow is following up their status
Dear Dennis,


Thank you for your enthusiasm in participating in our Tech Fellow Program. At the moment, we only have one Tech Fellow application from your school. Consistent to our [program guidelines](https://info.codepath.org/spring-2021-tech-fellow-scholarship-program), we are one candidate short before we are ready to start the training. To help us reach the required number of eligible applicants, I would like to encourage you to invite anyone you feel is qualified and interested in the program. If you know a schoolmate who is driven, ambitious and has what it takes to be a great leader, feel free to give them a tap. This will help speed up the process!

Rest assured, we will be keeping your application on file and as soon as another eligible student from your school expresses interest, we will reach out to you.

In the meantime, hereâ€™s a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5M0WC7zclo) that talks about the whole CodePath.Org Tech Fellow experience. Feel free to share it around!


Best Regards,
