# Scenario E: Applicant doesn’t know what the next steps are

Hello Jake,


I hope all is well!

I wanted to touch base with you regarding your application for our Android University Course. I went ahead and pulled your account, so I can better support you through the process. Below is a checklist of requirements and tasks that you need to complete to proceed with this course. I highlighted the part you may have missed.

To iterate, you:

- [ ] should have completed an intro to object oriented programming course or have existing familiarity
- [ ] should be pursuing a course of study related to computer science or software
- [x] should complete the [pre-work task](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/prework#heading-android-pre-work-todo-app)
- [ ] should be currently enrolled in the same college or university selected in their application (for on-campus cohorts) 
- [ ] should be currently enrolled in a US college or university (for the 6-week program) 

We appreciate the time and effort you invested into building your Todo App. You are now only a few steps away! If you can proceed to [submit your app via GitHub](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/prework#heading-31-submitting-via-github), that would be great. Please also [double-check for any possible issues](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/prework#heading-4-troubleshooting). We encourage you to [go a step further](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/prework#heading-5-extending-your-todo-app-further-advanced) by adding features and improving your app’s User Interface.

Once all the [requirements](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/syllabus#heading-prerequisites-and-eligibility) for this course are accomplished, we are ready to move forward with your application.

Here is the [detailed outline](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/syllabus#heading-codepath-org-android-course-syllabus) of the course as well as the [class schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFy_jQ5MIhF4bTzZE__s0gu0gQttloS3eIRzjoMC1Z0/edit). I hope this helps!
