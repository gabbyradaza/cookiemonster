# Scenario F: Correction on Attendance

Hi John,


I hope all is well! 

I went ahead and pulled up the online attendance sheet for your class and saw that you were only in for 10 minutes. By definition, cuts are classified as student absences. Our [Attendance Policy Statement](https://www.codepath.org/policies?/attendance) indicates that a student should be present for at least 50% of the duration of the class. If you feel the minutes were recorded by mistake, please let me know immediately, so I can file a dispute on your behalf. 

You also have the option to request for an excused absence through your course portal. Please check the details [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.codepath.org/help/how-to-request-an-excused-absence&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1625975232760000&usg=AOvVaw13VFaBkMQ2GzM2YrZ6YD9q).

Let me know if there’s anything else I can answer for you. I’m here to help. 


Best Regards,
