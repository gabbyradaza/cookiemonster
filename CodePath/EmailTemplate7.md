# Scenario G: Withdrawn student is requesting for reconsideration

Dear Vicki,


I am writing this letter to regretfully inform you that your request for reconsideration has been declined. We can assure you that we had put much thought into the merits of your case and found it would not be feasible for you to continue with the course this Spring. 

While we admire your commitment to finish the Cybersecurity course, we feel that we would be doing you a disservice if we let you carry on. Keeping several things in motion at one time can take its toll on anyone. The course in itself is overwhelming and we can only imagine what it would demand of you when you are enrolled with a full load this semester and also have work during the weekends. 

Please think of this as something you are just putting on the shelf for now. We hope that when your schedule opens up, you will revisit the idea of enrolling in our programs again. 

We wish you the very best of luck in all your endeavors and we look forward to seeing you again!


All the best,
