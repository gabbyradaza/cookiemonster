# Scenario H: Student who missed the submission deadline
Hi Douglas,


Congratulations on getting your first dose of a COVID shot and I hope you are feeling much better! I’m so sorry to hear that you missed the deadline for this week’s assignment because of it and partly due to technical difficulties.

Do not worry, I can absolutely help with that! Have you heard of our Tech Support Team? We have different channels for varying concerns of the students enrolled in our programs. For your specific concern, please reach out to CodePath Slack Guide for students, channel #android-unit01-spring21. You can also [sign up to our Discussions System using Github](https://discussions.codepath.com/sessions/login) for more reference.

Considering the circumstances, we’ve decided to give you an additional extension of 48 hours to complete your assignment. I went ahead and processed the request. You should receive a separate email stating that your appeal has been approved.

In case you need it in the future, this [link](https://hackmd.io/@patricia/BJz7mAtg8?type=view) will show you all the different support channels available to our students.

Should you have further questions, or need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to reach out!


All the best,
