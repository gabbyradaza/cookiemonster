# Scenario B: Applicant who is outside of the US


Dear Jane,


Thank you for getting in touch with us. I’m afraid we are unable to admit you as a beneficiary of any of the programs that we offer. We acknowledge the time and energy you put into your application as a requisite to our Mobile Product Development course. I feel that it should be pointed out that if you are within the areas our programs cover, we would be more than happy to have you on board.

We would love to be able to extend our admission to students outside the United States, and in fact, are now running classes in Haiti. Should we be allowed to extend our courses to applicants outside the United States, we hope you don’t mind that we reach out to you in the future.

Alternatively, you may also subscribe to our [mailing list](https://https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) so we can keep you posted if our classes become available in Thailand. 


Sincerely,
