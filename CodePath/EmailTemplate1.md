# Scenario A: Request to bump up to Advanced Track

Dear John, 


I want to start by letting you know that we are very much pleased with your academic standing. We carefully weighed the arguments you presented concerning the level of program you are currently admitted to and appreciate your eagerness to apply to a more advanced track. 

Ultimately, after much consideration, we decided to stand by our admission process which respects each application we receive. We maintain a transparent, fair, and consistent approach over all our students and are confident that our sectioning method is both constructive and effective.

In our decision making, we carefully consider several factors, including the needs and qualifications of each student. Please know that the levels do not reflect the success rate of our students after the program is completed. They are only designed for our students to get the best educational experience based on our [pre-evaluation process.](https://apply.codepath.org/cohorts/interview-prep-summer-2021/versions/student/)

With this said, I would like to congratulate you for a job well done. We are very pleased to have you in our Summer Technical Interview Prep Program - Beginner level. You have demonstrated a real understanding and commitment to this field and we are confident that you will be a great addition to our highly-gifted pool of students. 

We are very much excited to have you on board!


Best Regards,
